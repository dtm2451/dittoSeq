\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, or SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{sample.by}{String name of a per-cell metadata (a column of \code{colData(object)}) containing which sample each cell belongs to.
Recommendations for cyclone data, (standardiazed because they are required elements of the file_metadata input!): \itemize{
\item 'file_name': holds which original fcs file each cell came from.
\item 'donor_id': holds which patient/mouse each cell came from.
\item somthing else: sometimes, your data might both break up samples' data acquisition accross multiple .fcs files (so 'file_name' would then be too specific) & contain multiple timepoints or conditions per sample (so 'donor_id' is not specific enough).
In such a case, the burden lies on the user to create a viable metadata (\code{<object>$<metadata-name> <- <properly-uniqued-values>}, and then use \code{sample.by = <metadata-name>})
\item 'donor_id' & data subsetting with `cells.use`: As an alternative to creating a new metadata to use for \code{sample.by}, subsetting to only cells from a specific timepoint or condition might serve a dual purpose of achieving your specific analysis goal && allowing 'donor_id' to properly scope to individual samples.
See \code{cells.use} input description for further details.
}}

\item{cell.by}{String name of a per-cell metadata (a column of \code{colData(object)}) containing the cluster or cell annotation identities to quantify and assess.}

\item{group.by}{String name of a per-cell metadata (a column of \code{colData(object)}) containing sample-group identities.}

\item{group.1, group.2}{Strings naming the 2 groups within the \code{group.by} metadata which you aim to compare.}

\item{cell.targs}{(Optional) Single string or a string vector naming which cell groups of the \code{cell.by} metadata which should be targetted.
When not provided, the function will loop through all cell groups in the \code{cell.by} metadata.}

\item{cells.use}{String vector of cells'(/samples' for bulk data) names OR an integer vector specifying the indices of cells/samples which should be included.

Alternatively, a Logical vector, the same length as the number of cells in the object, which sets which cells to include.}

\item{pseudocount}{Number, zero by default. A value to add, within fold_change calculations only, to both \code{group.1} and \code{group.2} median frequencies in order to avoid division by zero errors.
When needed, we recommend something small relative to the lowest expected cell frequencies of the data, 0.000001 perhaps.
Although a relatively small value like this can lead to heavily inflated log fold change values in the extreme cases where \code{group.1} or \code{group.2} frequencies are 0 or near 0, a tiny pseudocount leaves all other fold change values only minimally affected.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{String, passed along to the \code{method} input of \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}, any valid option for that input will work. "fdr" by default.}

\item{data.out}{Logical. When set to \code{TRUE}, changes the output from the stats data.frame alone to a named list containing both the stats ("stats") and the underlying per-sample frequency calculations ("data").}
}
\value{
a data.frame, or if \code{data.out} was set to \code{TRUE}, a named list containing 2 data.frames, 'stats' and the underlying 'data'.
}
\description{
Calculate per-sample frequencies of clusters or cell annotations, and compare them across group.
}
\details{
The function starts by utilizing \code{\link{dittoFreqPlot}} for
\code{cell.by}-cell frequency calculation within \code{sample.by}-samples,
percent normalization,
marking which \code{sample.by}-samples belong to which \code{group.by}-groups,
and trimming to only: 1. requested \code{cell.targs}, 2. \code{group.by}-groups \code{group.1} and \code{group.2}, and 3. cells matching the \code{cells.use} requirements if any were given.
It then removes some unnecessary columns from the data.frame directly returned by \code{\link{dittoFreqPlot}}. (Set \code{data.out = TRUE} to see what this cleaned return looks like!)

Afterwards, it loops through all \code{cell.targs}, building a row of the eventual stats return for each.
Of note, a \code{pseudocount} can be introduced in median fold change calculation to prevent errors from division by zero. The use of a \code{pseudocount} has no effect on p-values.
Lastly, \code{p.adjust.method} correction, FDR by default, is applied to the 'p' column and added as a 'padj' column before data is returned.

\section{The stats data.frame return}{

Each row holds statistics for an individual comparison.
The columns represent:
\itemize{
\item cell_group: this row's cluster or cell-annotation
\item comparison: this groups of \code{group.by} compared in this row, formatted \code{<group.1>_vs_<group.2>}.
(For compatibility with running the function multiple times, each targwtting distinct groups, and then concatenating all outputs together!)
\item median_g1: the median frequency for the given cell_group within samples from \code{group.1}
\item median_g2: the median frequency for the given cell_group within samples from \code{group.2}
\item median_fold_change: \code{(median_g1 + pseudocount) / (median_g2 + pseudocount)}. Although zero by default, a small \code{pseudocount} can be set used to prevent division by zero error cases while only nominally affecting the value of other cases.
\item median_log2_fold_change: \code{log2( median_fold_change )}
\item positive_fc_means_up_in: Value = \code{group.1}, just a minor note to help remember the directionality of these fold changes!
\item p: The p-value associated with comparison of cell_group percent frequencies of group.1 samples versus group.2 samples using a Mann Whitney U Test / wilcoxon rank sum test (\code{\link[stats]{wilcox.test}}).
\item padj: p-values corrected by the chosen \code{p.adjust.method}, FDR by default, built from running \code{p.adjust(stats$p, method = p.adjust.method)} per all hypotheses tested in this call to the \code{freq_stats} function.
