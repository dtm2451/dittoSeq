\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, or SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{genes}{String vector, c("gene1","gene2","gene3",...) = the list of genes to put in the heatmap.
If not provided, defaults to all genes of the object / assay.}

\item{metas}{String vector, c("meta1","meta2","meta3",...) = the list of metadata variables to put in the heatmap.}

\item{cells.use}{String vector of cells'/samples' names OR an integer vector specifying the indices of cells/samples which should be included.

Alternatively, a Logical vector, the same length as the number of cells in the object, which sets which cells to include.}

\item{annot.by}{String name of any metadata slots containing how the cells/samples should be annotated.}

\item{order.by}{Single string, string vector, or numeric vector which sets how cells/samples (columns) will be ordered when \code{cluster_cols = FALSE}.

Strings should be the name of a gene, or metadata slot, but can also be multiple such values in order of priority.

Alternatively, can be a numeric vector which gives the column index order directly.}

\item{main}{String that sets the title for the heatmap.}

\item{cell.names.meta}{quoted "name" of a meta.data slot to use for naming the columns instead of using the raw cell/sample names.}

\item{assay, slot}{single strings or integers (SCEs and SEs) or an optionally named vector of such values that set which expression data to use.
See \code{\link{GeneTargeting}} for specifics and examples -- Seurat and SingleCellExperiment objects deal with these differently, and functionality additions in dittoSeq have led to some minimal divergence from the native methodologies.}

\item{swap.rownames}{optionally named string or string vector.
For SummarizedExperiment or SingleCellExperiment objects, its value(s) specifies the column name of rowData(object) to be used to identify features instead of rownames(object).
When targeting multiple modalities (alternative experiments), names can be used to specify which level / alternative experiment (use 'main' for the top-level) individual values should be used for.
See \code{\link{GeneTargeting}} for more specifics and examples.}

\item{heatmap.colors}{the colors to use within the heatmap when (default setting) \code{scaled.to.max} is set to \code{FALSE}.
Default is a ramp from navy to white to red with 50 slices.}

\item{scaled.to.max}{Logical, \code{FALSE} by default, which sets whether expression shoud be scaled between [0, 1].
This is recommended for single-cell datasets as they are generally enriched in 0s.}

\item{heatmap.colors.max.scaled}{the colors to use within the heatmap when \code{scaled.to.max} is set to \code{TRUE}.
Default is a ramp from white to red with 25 slices.}

\item{annot.colors}{String (color) vector where each color will be assigned to an individual annotation in the generated annotation bars.}

\item{data.out}{Logical. When set to \code{TRUE}, changes the output from the heatmat itself, to a list containing all arguments that would have be passed to \code{\link{pheatmap}} for heatmap generation.
(Can be useful for troubleshooting or customization.)}

\item{highlight.features}{String vector of genes/metadata whose names you would like to show. Only these genes/metadata will be named in the resulting heatmap.}

\item{show_colnames, show_rownames, scale, annotation_col, annotation_colors}{arguments passed to \code{pheatmap} that are over-ruled by certain \code{dittoHeatmap} functionality:
\itemize{
\item show_colnames (& labels_col): if \code{cell.names.meta} is provided, pheatmaps's \code{labels_col} is utilized to show these names and \code{show_colnames} parameter is set to \code{TRUE}.
\item show_rownames (& labels_row): if feature names are provided to \code{highlight.features}, pheatmap's \code{labels_row} is utilized to show just these features' names and \code{show_rownames} parameter is set to \code{TRUE}.
\item scale: when parameter \code{scaled.to.max} is set to true, pheatmap's \code{scale} is set to \code{"none"} and the max scaling is performed prior to the pheatmap call.
\item annotation_col: Can be provided as normal by the user and any metadata given to \code{annot.by} will then be appended.
\item annotation_colors: dittoHeatmap fills this complicated-to-produce input in automatically by pulling from the colors given to \code{annot.colors},
but it is possible to set all or some manually. dittoSeq will just fill any left out annotations. Format is a named (annotation_col & annotation_row colnames) character vector list where individual color values can also be named.
}}

\item{cluster_cols, border_color, legend_breaks, breaks, drop_levels, ...}{other arguments passed to \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}} directly (or to \code{\link[ComplexHeatmap]{pheatmap}} if \code{complex = TRUE}).}

\item{complex}{Logical which sets whether the heatmap should be generated with ComplexHeatmap (\code{TRUE}) versus pheatmap (\code{FALSE}, default).}
}
\value{
A \code{pheatmap} object.

Alternatively, if \code{complex} is set to \code{TRUE}, a \code{\link[ComplexHeatmap]{Heatmap}}

Alternatively, if \code{data.out} is set to \code{TRUE}, a list containing all arguments that would have be passed to pheatmap to generate such a heatmap.
}
\description{
Given a set of genes, cells/samples, and metadata names for column annotations, this function will retrieve the expression data for those genes and cells, and the annotation data for those cells.
It will then utilize these data to make a heatmap using the \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}} function of either the \code{pheatmap} (default) or \code{ComplexHeatmap} package.
}
\details{
This function serves as a wrapper for creating heatmaps from bulk or single-cell RNAseq data with pheatmap::\code{\link{pheatmap}},
by essentially automating the data extraction and annotation building steps.
(Or alternatively with ComplexHeatmap::\code{\link[ComplexHeatmap]{pheatmap}} if \code{complex} is set to \code{true}.

The function will extract the expression matrix for a set of \code{genes} and/or an optional subset of cells / samples to use via \code{cells.use},
This matrix is either left as is, default (for scaling within the ultimate call to pheatmap), or if \code{scaled.to.max = TRUE}, is scaled by dividing each row by its maximum value.

When provided with a set of metadata slot names to use for building annotations (with the \code{annot.by} input),
the relevant metadata is retrieved from the \code{object} and compiled into a \code{pheatmap}-ready \code{annotation_col} input.
The input \code{annot.colors} is used to establish the set of colors that should be used for building a \code{pheatmap}-ready \code{annotation_colors} input as well,
unless such an input has been provided by the user. See below for further details.
}
\section{Many additional characteristics of the plot can be adjusted using discrete inputs}{

\itemize{
\item The cells can be ordered in a set way using the \strong{\code{order.by}} input.

Such ordering happens by default for single-cell RNAseq data when any metadata are provided to \code{annot.by} as it is often unfeasible to cluster thousands of cells.
\item A plot title can be added with \strong{\code{main}}.
\item Gene or cell/sample names can be hidden with \code{show_rownames} and \code{show_colnames}, respectively, or...
\itemize{
\item Particular features can also be selected for labeling using the \code{highlight.features} input.
\item Names of all cells/samples can be replaced with the contents of a metadata slot using the \code{cell.names.meta} input.
}
\item Additional tweaks are possible through use of \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}} inputs which will be directly passed through.
Some examples of useful \code{pheatmap} parameters are:
\itemize{
\item \code{cluster_cols} and \code{cluster_rows} for controlling clustering.
Note: cluster_cols will always be over-written to be \code{FALSE} when the input \code{order.by} is used above.
\item \code{treeheight_row} and \code{treeheight_col} for setting how large the trees on the side/top should be drawn.
\item \code{cutree_col} and \code{cutree_row} for spliting the heatmap based on kmeans clustering
}
\item When \code{complex} is set to \code{TRUE}, additional inputs for the \code{\link[ComplexHeatmap]{Heatmap}} function can be given as well.
Some examples:
\itemize{
\item \code{use_raster} to have the heatmap rasterized/flattened to pixels which can make working with large heatmaps in a figure editor, like Illustrator, simpler.
\item \code{name} to give the heatmap color scale a custom title.
}
}
}

\section{Customized annotations}{

In typical operation, dittoHeatmap pulls metadata annotations given to \code{annot.by} to build a pheatmap-\code{annotation_col} input,
then it uses the colors provided to \code{annot.colors} to create the pheatmap-\code{annotation_colors} input which sets the annotation coloring.
Specifically...
\itemize{
\item colors for the values of \strong{discrete} metadata are pulled from the \emph{start} of the \code{annot.colors} vector, in the order that they are given to \code{annot.by}
\item colors for the values of \strong{continuous} metadata are pulled from the \emph{end} of the \code{annot.colors} vector, in the order that they are given to \code{annot.by}
}

To customize colors or add additional column or row annotations, users can also provide \code{annotation_colors}, \code{annotation_col}, or \code{annotation_row} pheatmap-inputs directly.
General structure is described below, but see \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}} for additional details and examples.
\itemize{
\item \code{annotation_col} = a data.frame with rownames of the barcodes/names of all cells/samples in the dataset & columns representing annotations.
Names of columns are used as the annotation titles. *dittoSeq will append any \code{annot.by} annotations to this dataframe.
\item \code{annotation_row} = a data.frame with rownames of the genes/feature of the dataset & columns representing annotations.
Names of columns are used as the annotation titles.
\item \code{annotation_colors} = a named list of string (color) vectors.
Vectors must be named by the row or column annotation title that they are associated with.
Optionally, individual colors can be named with the values that they should be associated with.

Partial \code{annotation_colors} lists (containing vectors for only certain annotations) will have colors for left out annotations filled in automatically.
For such filling, \code{annot.colors} are pulled for column annotations first, then for row annotations.
}

\examples{
example(importDittoBulk, echo = FALSE)
scRNA <- setBulk(myRNA, FALSE)

# We now have two SCEs for our example purposes:
  # 'myRNA' will be treated as a bulk RNAseq dataset
  # 'scRNA' will be treated as a single-cell RNAseq dataset

# Pick a set of genes
genes <- getGenes(myRNA)[1:30]

# Make a heatmap with cells/samples annotated by their clusters
dittoHeatmap(myRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "clustering")

# For single-cell data, you will typically have more cells than can be
# clustered quickly. Thus, cell clustering is turned off by default for
# single-cell data.
dittoHeatmap(scRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "clustering")

# Using the 'order.by' input:
#   Ordering by a useful metadata or gene is often helpful.
#   For single-cell data, order.by defaults to the first element given to
#     annot.by.
#   For bulk data, order.by must be set separately.
dittoHeatmap(myRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "clustering",
    order.by = "clustering",
    cluster_cols = FALSE)
# 'order.by' can be multiple metadata/genes, or a vector of indexes directly 
dittoHeatmap(scRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "clustering",
    order.by = c("clustering", "timepoint"))
dittoHeatmap(scRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "clustering",
    order.by = ncol(scRNA):1)

# When there are many cells, showing names becomes less useful.
#   Names can be turned off with the 'show_colnames' parameter.
dittoHeatmap(scRNA, genes,
    annot.by = "groups",
    show_colnames = FALSE)

# When theree are many many cells & genes, rasterization can be super useful
# as well.
#   Rasterization, or flattening of the distinct color objects to a matrix of
#   pixels, is the default for large heatmaps in the ComplexHeatmap package,
#   and you can have the heatmap rendered with this package (rather than the
#   pheatmap package) by setting 'complex = TRUE'.
#   Our data here is too small to hit that defaulting switch, so lets give
#   the direct input, 'use_raster' as well:
if (requireNamespace("ComplexHeatmap")) { # Checks if you have the package.
    dittoHeatmap(scRNA, genes, annot.by = "groups", show_colnames = FALSE,
        complex = TRUE,
        use_raster = TRUE)
}

# Additionally, it is recommended for single-cell data that the parameter
#   scaled.to.max be set to TRUE, or scale be "none" and turned off altogether,
#   because these data are generally enriched for zeros that otherwise get
#   scaled to a negative value.
dittoHeatmap(myRNA, genes, annot.by = "groups",
    order.by = "groups", show_colnames = FALSE,
    scaled.to.max = TRUE)
